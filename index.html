 <h2>Ronaldo Willie</h2>
 <p>i am ronaldo willie, named after th legendary brazillian forward, Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima. I myself play football but as a winger. My hobbies include reading, listening music and playing video games. Currently persuing a degree in Computer Science, i thought it would be beneficial to do this course so as to broaden my programming skills. I have always been interested in knowing to do web programming and with the knowledge obtained, i wish do it for a living. </p>
